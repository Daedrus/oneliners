=== FIND ===

- Recursively find files ending in .tmp in the current folder and remove them.
  The string '{}' is replaced by the current file name being processed
  everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the command. '\' is used to escape
  ';' so that the shell does not process it.

    find . -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;

=== AWK ===

- Match lines with pattern "whitespace* + word + whitespace* + word"; Useful
  when looking for structs which have fields with the same name as their type.

    awk 'match($0, /\s([[:alnum:]_]*)\s([[:alnum:]_]*);/, matches) {if (matches[1]==matches[2]) {print NR matches[0];}}'

=== GIT ===

- List all commits which have modified a specific file

    - Git log traversal might omit some commits

        git log path/to/file

    - This one includes commits from all refs/, along with HEAD

        git rev-list --all -- path/to/file

- List all commits which have modified a specific file with a specific pattern

    git grep testpattern $(git rev-list --all -- path/to/file) -- path/to/file

=== VIMDIFF ===

- Export output to an HTML file called diff.html

    vimdiff  file1.txt file2.txt -c TOhtml -c 'w! diff.html' -c 'qa!'
