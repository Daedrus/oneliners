=== AWK ===

- Match lines with pattern "whitespace* + word + whitespace* + word"; Useful when looking for structs which have fields with the same name as their type.

    awk 'match($0, /\s([[:alnum:]_]*)\s([[:alnum:]_]*);/, matches) {if (matches[1]==matches[2]) {print NR matches[0];}}'

=== GIT ===

- List all commits which have modified a specific file

    - Git log traversal might omit some commits

        git log path/to/file

    - This one includes commits from all refs/, along with HEAD

        git rev-list --all -- path/to/file

- List all commits which have modified a specific file with a specific pattern

    git grep testpattern $(git rev-list --all -- path/to/file) -- path/to/file
